    <h2>What is Scrapyard?</h2>
    <p>Scrapyard is a Firefox bookmarking extension where you can store and organize bookmarks, page fragments or complete documents
        in unlimited quantities. By utilizing browser local storage Scrapyard does not require
        external tools to operate and allows to import/export data in
        <a href="https://orgmode.org" target="_blank">org-mode</a> or <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> formats.</p>

    <p>
        Scrapyard sidebar could be opened with a <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox" target="_blank">
        customizable</a> keyboard shortcut <code>Alt+Y</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>General features</h2>

    <h3>Capturing Pages</h3>
    <p>
        To capture a web-page or its fragment, select the page part you want to archive, open Scrapyard popup window
        by clicking the icon on the browser toolbar, choose the necessary destination folder and press the "Bookmark"
        or "Archive" button. The "Bookmark" button stores only web-page URLs, while the "Archive" button stores
        the current selection, the whole page (if there is no active selection) or the whole document, if the opened
        link is not a web-page. <br/><br/>

    <div style="text-align: center">
        <img src="/addon/online_help/_locales/en/images/capture-popup.png">
    </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Bookmark Shelves</h3>
    <p>
        It is possible to create an unlimited amount of bookmark shelves to structure your captures.
        The shelf named "everything" allows to browse and search through all existing shelves. Scrapyard built-in
        shelves are listed in bold font and cannot be deleted or renamed (including the "default" one).</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="/addon/online_help/_locales/en/images/shelves.png">
    </p>

    <p>In the bookmark tree archived pages are marked with the italic font, while ordinary bookmarks have the regular one.</p>

    <h3>Cloud Bookmarking</h3>
    <p>
        Adding or copying/pasting bookmarks into a special shelf named Cloud makes them available across different
        Firefox instances that use the same cloud provider. Cloud providers are configurable at the addon settings.
        <a href="https://scrapyard.page.link/android" target="_blank">Scrapyard application for Android</a>
        allows to share links and content to the Cloud shelf from mobile devices.
    </p>

        <img src="/addon/online_help/_locales/en/images/cloud.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Sharing Bookmarks</h3>
    <p>
        A bookmark or archive could be shared to either <a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket</a> or
        <a href="https://dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> through the "Share" context menu of the item. Files
        that are shared to Dropbox appear at the "Apps/Scrapyard" Dropbox folder. Only links could be shared to the Pocket
        application.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="/addon/online_help/_locales/en/images/sharing.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Firefox Bookmarks</h3>
    <p>
        Scrapyard seamlessly integrates with Firefox bookmarks, so there is no need to switch to the built-in bookmark
        manager. You may attach notes and TODO states to Firefox bookmarks displayed in Scrapyard, although
        they will be lost if the bookmarks are deleted from Firefox UI, or after "Show Firefox bookmarks shelf"
        option in settings is unchecked. Firefox bookmarks are included in the export but are imported
        as a separate Scrapyard shelf, leaving the current Firefox bookmark state intact.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="/addon/online_help/_locales/en/images/firefox.png">
    </p>

    <h3>TODO</h3>
    <p>It may be convenient to prioritize your bookmarks for processing. Each bookmark may have one of the following
        TODO priorities: TODO, WAITING or POSTPONED. You may find all your prioritized bookmarks
        at the built-in shelf named <b>TODO</b>, sorted in the corresponding order. All bookmarks marked as DONE or CANCELLED
        are displayed at the <b>DONE</b> shelf.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="/addon/online_help/_locales/en/images/todo.png">
    </p>

    <p>If the path of a bookmark provides not enough context, it is possible to fill the "Details" and "Date"
        fields in bookmark properties. Only ISO (YYYY-MM-DD) date format is supported.
        Expired TODO items will be displayed first regardless of the assigned state.</p>

    <h3>Markers</h3>
    <p>Every archived page provides an editing toolbar which offers several types of text markers and also allows
        to clean pages of unnecessary elements. Page HTML may also be edited through the browser development tools accessible
        by "F12" keyboard key.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="/addon/online_help/_locales/en/images/markers.png">
    </p>

    <p>The "Auto open" check makes the marker menu to open automatically when some text is selected.</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>It is possible to attach notes to every bookmark or even create dedicated note-only bookmarks. Items with
        non-empty notes are highlighted by the underlined text in the bookmark tree.
        The notes may contain a brief document summary or any other relevant information and could be entered in
        plain text, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a>
        or <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Markup.html" target="_blank">org-mode markup</a>. A short CSS-style may be placed
        at the first lines of the text to modify its appearance, org notes may have a table of contents.
        Insert an example markup into the note editor to explore what options are available.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="/addon/online_help/_locales/en/images/notes.png">
    </p>

    <h4>Referencing to a bookmark or archive</h4>
    <p>To make a reference to a Scrapyard bookmark or archive from the note markup create a link with the following URL:
        <b><code>ext+scrapyard://&lt;BOOKMARK UUID&gt;</code></b>, for example:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7</code></b>

    <p>When necessary, it is possible to add a hash with a link description:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7#short-bookmark-description</code></b>

    <p>To refer the notes of a bookmark add <b><code>notes:</code></b> before the UUID:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://notes:A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7</code></b>

    <p>Bookmark UUID is available from its property dialog:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="/addon/online_help/_locales/en/images/references.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Import/Export</h3>

    <p>Scrapyard allows to import bookmarks in Netscape HTML format which you may obtain from Firefox, Chrome or other
    web-browsers. It is also allows to import and export its own collections of bookmarks or archived pages in ORG and
    JSON formats through the corresponding item in the shelf operations menu:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="/addon/online_help/_locales/en/images/impexp.png">
    </p>

    <p>See "Import RDF" section of the add-on settings page for the detailed instructions on importing legacy ScrapBook
        RDF archives.</p>

    <h2>Advanced features</h2>

    <h3>Natural Language Interface (optional)</h3>
    <p>
        It is possible to issue commands to Scrapyard through the natural language interface offered by
        <a href="https://gchristensen.github.io/ubiquitywe/"  target="_blank">UbiquityWE</a> extension.
        To control Scrapyard by text commands just install UbiquityWE. In most cases, the command interface
        allows to significantly reduce the number of actions needed to create a bookmark or a page archive.
    </p>

    <h3>The "bookmark" and "archive" Commands</h3>
    <p>Use the "bookmark" or "archive" commands with the corresponding parameters to archive a page into the specified destination.
        Folders in the path will be created automatically if they do not exist. The first folder in the bookmark path
        is always interpreted as the name of a bookmark shelf. The name of the "default" shelf may be substituted by "~" character.
        Contents of Firefox "Bookmarks Menu" and "Other Bookmarks" may be accessed with "@" and "@@" shortcuts respectively.</p>

    </p>

    <h3>The "scrapyard" Command</h3>

    <p>The "scrapyard" command allows to browse and filter captured bookmarks. See Ubiquity help for more details.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>Creating Custom Capture Commands</h3>

    <p>If you often save bookmarks with similar properties to the same destination, it is possible to create custom
        capture commands with predefined parameters. "CAPTURE" link at the bottom-right of UbiquityWE command editor allows
        to insert a template of such command. In addition to the predefined parameters, custom capture commands allow to
        specify (comma-separated) CSS selectors for elements that will be filtered or deleted automatically.
        A custom CSS-style could be inserted into the captured document through the "style" option.</p>
