    <h2>What is Scrapyard?</h2>
    <p>Scrapyard is a Firefox bookmarking extension where you can store and organize bookmarks, page
        fragments or complete documents in unlimited quantities. By utilizing browser local storage,
        Scrapyard does not require external tools for basic functionality and allows to
        import/export data in <a
            href="https://orgmode.org" target="_blank">org-mode</a> or <a
            href="https://www.jsonlines.org/">JSON</a> formats. With Scrapyard native helper
        application it is also possible to import RDF archives of the legacy Firefox ScrapBook
        extension.</p>

    <h3>Where to Find Scrapyard</h3>

    <p>Scrapyard is accessible through the dropdown menu of <a
        href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-sidebar-access-bookmarks-history-synced"
        target="_blank">Firefox sidebar</a> as shown in the image below. The sidebar
        itself could be opened with the corresponding toolbar button: <img
            style="display: inline-block" src="images/help/sidebar-button.png">. In the more recent
        versions of Firefox it may be necessary to add this button to the toolbar manually.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/find-sidebar.png">
    </div>

    <p>
        Additionally, the <code>Alt+Y</code> keyboard shortcut allows to open Scrapyard directly.
        Keyboard shortcuts provided by any extension could be <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox" target="_blank">
        customized</a> in Firefox settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Features</h2>

    <h3>Capturing Pages</h3>
    <p>
        To capture a web-page or its fragment, select the part of the page you want to archive, open Scrapyard popup window
        by clicking its icon on the browser toolbar, choose the destination shelf and folder, then press "Bookmark"
        or "Archive" button. The "Bookmark" button stores only web-page URLs, while the "Archive" button captures
        the current selection, the whole page, if there is no active selection, or the whole document, if the opened
        link is not a web-page (for example, a PDF file).</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/capture-popup.png">
    </p>

    <p>In the bookmark tree, archived pages are marked with the italic font, while ordinary bookmarks have the regular one.</p>

    <h3>Bookmark Shelves</h3>
    <p>
        It is possible to create an unlimited amount of bookmark shelves to structure your bookmarks.
        The shelf named "everything" allows to browse and search through all existing bookmarks. Scrapyard built-in
        shelves are listed in bold font and cannot be deleted or renamed (including the "default" one).</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/shelves.png">
    </p>



    <h3>Cloud Bookmarking</h3>
    <p>
        Adding or copying/pasting bookmarks into a special shelf named Cloud makes them available
        across different Firefox instances that use a cloud provider with the same credentials.
        Cloud providers are configurable at the addon settings (currently, only Dropbox is
        supported). <a
        href="https://scrapyard.page.link/android" target="_blank">Scrapyard application for
        Android</a> allows to save links and content into the Cloud shelf from mobile devices.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/cloud.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Sharing Bookmarks</h3>
    <p>
        A bookmark or archive could be shared to either <a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket</a> or
        <a href="https://dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> through the "Share" context menu of the item. Files
        that are shared to Dropbox appear at the "Apps/Scrapyard" Dropbox folder. Only links could be shared to the Pocket
        application.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/sharing.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Firefox Bookmarks</h3>
    <p>
        Scrapyard seamlessly integrates with Firefox bookmarks, so there is no need to switch to the built-in bookmark
        manager. You may attach comments and TODO states to Firefox bookmarks displayed in Scrapyard, although
        they will be lost if the bookmarks are deleted from Firefox UI, or after "Show Firefox bookmarks shelf"
        option in settings is unchecked. Firefox bookmarks are included in the export a separate shelf,
        so import will leave the current Firefox bookmark state intact.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/firefox.png">
    </p>

    <h3>TODO</h3>
    <p>It may be convenient to prioritize your bookmarks for processing with TODO states. Each bookmark may have one of the following
        TODO priorities: TODO, WAITING or POSTPONED. You may find all your prioritized bookmarks
        at the built-in shelf named <b>TODO</b>, sorted in the corresponding order. All bookmarks marked as DONE or CANCELLED
        are displayed at the <b>DONE</b> shelf.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/todo.png">
    </p>

    <p>If the path of a bookmark parent folder above its title provides not enough context, it is possible to fill the "Details" and "Date"
        fields at the bookmark property dialog. Only ISO (YYYY-MM-DD) date format is supported.
        Expired TODO items will be displayed first regardless of the assigned state.</p>

    <h3>Markers</h3>
    <p>Every archived page provides an toolbar which offers several types of text markers to
        highlight sections of interest. The "Auto open" check makes the marker menu to open
        automatically when some text is selected. The "Edit document" button allows to clean the
        document of unnecessary elements by direct editing of its content. It is also possible to
        type in something, press F7 to display the caret. Alternatively, HTML code of a page may be
        modified through the browser developer tools accessible through the F12 keyboard key.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/markers.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Bookmark Comments</h3>
    <p>While the "Details" field in the bookmark properties is intended for display at the TODO shelf,
    bookmark property dialog also allows to enter quick comments by clicking on the "page" icon at its top-right corner.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/comments-icon.png">
    </p>

    <p>Subsequent clicks on the icon alternate between the comment input field and bookmark properties.</p>

    <p>The comment icon of bookmarks with filled-in comments takes the form of a "lined page".</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/filled-comments.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>It is possible to attach more elaborate text notes with hyperlinks and images to every
        bookmark, or even create dedicated note-only bookmarks. Click "Open notes" in the context
        menu of a bookmark to show its note editor/viewer. Click "New notes" in the context menu of
        a folder to create a note-only bookmark. Items with non-empty notes are highlighted by the
        underlined text in the bookmark tree.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/notes.png">
    </p>

        <p>Notes could be entered in HTML (using a visual editor),
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a>,
        <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Markup.html" target="_blank">org-mode markup</a> or plain text.
            The format selector dropdown list is located at the bottom left corner of the "Edit" tab.</p>

    <p>The alignment selector, which is placed at the bottom left of the "View" tab, allows to select the overall note
        alignment (left or centered) on per note basis.</p>

    <p>A short CSS-style may be placed at the first lines of the notes of any format (except the
        plain text) to modify their appearance. For example, to change the width of HTML-formatted
        notes to 600 pixels, place the following snippet at the beginning of the document markup:</p>

<pre style="font-size: 10pt; padding: 0 36px; font-family: 'Lucida Console', monospace;">&lt;style&gt;
  #notes {width: 600px;}
&lt;/style&gt;</pre>

    <p>The markup of HTML-formatted notes is accessible through the corresponding
    editor button: <img src="images/help/edit-markup-button.png" style="display: inline-block">

    <p>Notes in Org format may have an automatically generated table of contents.
        Insert the example markup into the note editor to explore what options are available.</p>

    <h3>Referencing to a bookmark or archive</h3>
    <p>To make a reference to a Scrapyard bookmark or archive from the note markup create a link with the following URL:
        <b><code>ext+scrapyard://&lt;BOOKMARK UUID&gt;</code></b>, for example:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7</code></b>

    <p>When necessary, it is possible to add a hash with a link description:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7#short-bookmark-description</code></b>

    <p>To refer the notes of a bookmark add <b><code>notes:</code></b> before the UUID:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://notes:A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7</code></b>

    <p>UUID of a bookmark is available from its property dialog:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/references.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Search</h3>
    <p>The search input field at the Scrapyard sidebar allows to filter bookmarks of the current shelf
        by title/URL, tags, or the content of the archived pages. Use the "Everything" shelf to search through all
        bookmarks.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/search-sidebar.png">
    </p>

    <p>Additionally, it is possible to search through all bookmarks by title or URL from the Firefox
    URL-bar after entering the special "scr" keyword followed by a space:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/search-urlbar.png">
    </p>


    <h3>Import/Export</h3>

    <p>Scrapyard allows to import bookmarks in Netscape HTML format which you may obtain from Firefox, Chrome or other
    web-browsers. Its own collections of bookmarks and archived pages could also be exported or imported in ORG and
    JSON formats through the corresponding items of the shelf operations menu:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/impexp.png">
    </p>

    <p>Install Scrapyard helper application if you need to export the large amount of content (greater than
        the volume of the available system RAM).</p>

    <h3>Importing Legacy ScrapBook RDF Archives</h3>

    <p>To import legacy ScrapBook RDF archives you also need to install Scrapyard <a
        href="#helperapp"
        onmouseenter="this.href='https://github.com/GChristensen/scrapyard/releases'">helper
        application</a>. There are two import modes: the full import, which transfers saved files into
        the Scrapyard database, and the quick import which only recreates RDF directory structure and
        leaves the archived ScrapBook files on disk. See the "Import RDF" tab of the settings page
        for more details about the available import options.</p>

        <p>Shelves imported in quick mode are marked with a tape reel icon. It is possible to add
            new archives to them (added bookmarks are not included into the underlying RDF file),
            and physically delete RDF entries along with its files. Although, when the entire shelf
            is deleted from Scrapyard, the corresponding RDF file and the archived pages are left intact.
            Some features, such as page editing and bookmark transferring/copying are not available for
            the shelves imported in quick mode.</p>

        <p>It is possible to edit the path of the imported RDF file through the "RDF Directory..." context
        menu item of a shelf.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/quick-imported-rdf.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying Random Bookmarks</h3>

    <p>Random bookmarks from your collection could be displayed at the bottom of the Scrapyard sidebar.
        Check the corresponding option in the settings to enable this feature. The displayed
        bookmark is refreshed every 5 minutes, it also could be updated by a user request through
        the "Refresh" button. The magnifier button at the bookmark bar shown below selects the
        current bookmark at the Scrapyard sidebar by opening the shelf and folder in which it is located.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/random-bookmark.png">
    </p>

    <h2>Saving Links and Content from Mobile Applications</h2>

    <p> <a href="https://scrapyard.page.link/android" target="_blank">Scrapyard application for
        Android</a> allows to save links and content into the Scrapyard Cloud shelf from mobile devices.
        It uses standard Android sharing functionality, which may be tricky to deal
        with, as it is shown in the examples below.</p>

    <p>At first, you need to enable cloud support in Scrapyard itself by
        checking the corresponding option at the "Cloud" setting tab and sign into Dropbox.</p>

    <p>Then you need to install the Scrapyard application on your device and sign into the same Dropbox
    account from its front window.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/android-sign-in.png">
    </p>

    <p>To share a link from the application of choice, find and tap the "Share" button or menu item in it.
    The example below highlights the "Share" button in the mobile Firefox application.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/android-share-link.png">
    </p>

    <p>After that, you need to select the destination application to send URL into. The interface may
        differ from app to app, and you may need to scroll or press additional buttons to find the
        necessary sharing target. The icon of the Scrapyard Android application is highlighted
        on the image below. Tap on it and you are done.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/android-share-app.png">
    </p>

    <p>Sharing of text is usually performed from the corresponding selection toolbar:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/android-share-text.png">
    </p>

    <p>
        It is only possible to share plain text without links and images from Android platform.
        Generally, selected text is shared to Scrapyard in the form of notes without any source URL.
        To save source URL share text from the Pocket app.
    </p>

    <h2>Text Command Interface</h2>
    <p>
        It is possible to issue commands to Scrapyard through the text command interface offered by
        <a href="https://gchristensen.github.io/ishell/" target="_blank">iShell Extension</a>.
        To control Scrapyard by text commands just install iShell. In most cases, the command interface
        allows to significantly reduce the number of actions needed to create a bookmark or to archive a page.
    </p>

    <h3>The "bookmark" and "archive" Commands</h3>

    <p>Use the "bookmark" or "archive" commands with the corresponding arguments to bookmark/archive
        a page into the specified destination. The arguments allow to specify bookmark title,
        details, path, tags, TODO state and expiration date. Folders in the bookmark path will be
        autocompleted by iShell and created if they do not exist. The first folder in the path is
        always interpreted as a shelf name. The tilde (~) character may be used in place of the
        "default" shelf. Contents of the Firefox "Bookmarks Menu" and "Other Bookmarks" bookmark
        folders may be accessed with the "@" and "@@" shortcuts respectively.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/capture-nl.png">
    </p>

    <h3>The "scrapyard" Command</h3>

    <p>The "scrapyard" command allows to browse and search through the collection of bookmarks at
        the specified destination. See iShell command help for more details.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/help/scrapyard-command.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Creating Custom Capture Commands</h3>

    <p>If you often save bookmarks with similar properties to the same destination, it is possible to create custom
        capture commands with predefined parameters. The "CAPTURE" link at the bottom-right corner of iShell command editor allows
        to insert a template of a such command. In addition to the predefined parameters, custom capture commands allow to
        specify comma-separated CSS selectors for elements that will only be retained or deleted automatically.
        A custom CSS-style could be inserted into the captured document through the "style" option.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
