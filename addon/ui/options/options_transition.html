<h2>Transferring Scrapyard Content to the Filesystem</h2>


<div style="max-width: 600px; font-size: 110%; text-align: justify">
<p>Since version 2, Scrapyard is able to store the archived content in the filesystem. This requires
the installation of the Scrapyard native application. If you are not ready
for this change, it is possible to disable the automatic transition by clicking on
<a id="disable-transition" href="#">this</a> link. This will leave the archived content
in the browser internal storage.</p>

<p>The instructions below describe the process of transferring the archived content
from the browser internal storage to the filesystem.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Before performing the transition, you might want to back up your browser profile.
    In Firefox, you can find your browser profile path at the <b>about:support</b> settings page.
    In Chrome, the current profile path could be found at the following URL: <b>chrome://version</b>
    </li>

    <li>Download and install the Scrapyard <a href="#nativeapp">native application</a> version 2.0+.
    It is necessary to close the browser before the installation.</li>

    <li>Open the <a href="#settings">Settings</a> options tab and specify the directory where
        you want to keep your archived content.</li>

    <li>Click on the "Transfer content" link.</li>

    <li>Make sure that the archived content is transferred successfully.</li>

    <li>Open the <a href="#advanced">Advanced</a> options tab and click on the
        "Reset internal storage" link.</li>

    <li>After the reset is finished, restart your browser.</li>
