<h2>Transferring Scrapyard Content to the Filesystem</h2>


<div style="max-width: 600px; font-size: 110%; text-align: justify">
<p>Since version 2, Scrapyard stores archived content in the filesystem. This makes
the installation of the Scrapyard helper application mandatory. If you are not ready
for this change, please install Scrapyard version 1 from
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4009178/scrapyard-1.3.2.xpi">this</a> link
and disable automatic updates in the add-on settings at <b>about:addons</b>.
Rollback to version 1 on Google Chrome is impossible.</p>

<p>Scrapyard version 1 stores archived content in the browser internal
database. Scrapyard version 2 can not directly access the content archived with version 1 of the add-on.
The instructions below describe the process of transferring the archived content
from the browser internal storage to the filesystem.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Before performing the transition, you might want to back up your browser profile.
    In Firefox, you can find your browser profile path at the <b>about:support</b> settings page.
    In Chrome, the current profile path could be found at the following URL: <b>chrome://version</b>
    </li>

    <li>Download and install the Scrapyard <a href="#helperapp">helper application</a> version 2.0+.
    It is necessary to close the browser before the installation.</li>

    <li>Open the <a href="#settings">Settings</a> options tab and specify the directory where
        you want to keep your archived content.</li>

    <li>Click on the "Transfer content" link.</li>

    <li>Make sure that the archived content is transferred successfully.</li>

    <li>Open the <a href="#advanced">Advanced</a> options tab and click on the
        "Reset internal storage" link.</li>

    <li>Restart your browser.</li>
</ol>
