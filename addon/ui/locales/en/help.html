    <h2>What is Scrapyard?</h2>
    <p>Scrapyard is a Firefox bookmarking extension where you can store and organize bookmarks, page
        fragments, or complete HTML pages and PDF documents in unlimited quantities.
        Unlike most others ScrapBook alternatives, Scrapyard does not require installing external tools
        for most of its functionality by keeping the data in the browser internal storage.
        If necessary, it is possible to keep your content on disk for synchronization through a
        cloud service, or import/export all your bookmarks in <a
            href="https://orgmode.org" target="_blank">org-mode</a> or <a
            href="https://www.jsonlines.org/">JSON</a> formats. Scrapyard also supports
        import of RDF archives of the legacy ScrapBook addon.
    </p>

    <h3>Where to Find Scrapyard</h3>

    <p>Scrapyard is accessible through the dropdown menu of the <a
        href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-sidebar-access-bookmarks-history-synced"
        target="_blank">Firefox sidebar</a> as shown in the image below. The sidebar
        itself could be opened with the corresponding toolbar button: <img
            style="display: inline-block" src="images/sidebar-button.png">. In the more recent
        versions of Firefox, it may be necessary to add this button to the toolbar manually by selecting "Customize Toolbar..."
        at Main menu > More tools.</p>

    <p>
        The <code>Alt+Y</code> keyboard shortcut allows opening Scrapyard directly.
        Keyboard shortcuts provided by any extension could be <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox" target="_blank">
        customized</a> in Firefox settings.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/find-sidebar.png">
    </p>

    <h2>Main Features</h2>

    <h3 id="page-capture-manual">Capturing Pages</h3>
    <p>
        To capture a web page or its fragment, select the part of the page you want to archive, open the Scrapyard popup window
        by clicking its icon on the browser toolbar, choose the destination shelf and folder, then press the "Bookmark"
        or "Archive" button. The "Bookmark" button stores only web-page URLs as bookmarks. The "Archive" button captures
        the current selection, the whole page, if there is no active selection, or the whole document, if the opened
        link is not a web-page (for example, a PDF file). </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/capture-popup.png">
    </p>

    <p>
        The following keyboard shortcuts allow to quickly capture the
        active tab into the default bookmark shelf:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>Alt+Q</code> - bookmark the current tab to the default shelf.</li>
        <li><code>Alt+W</code> - archive the current tab or selection to the default shelf.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the bookmark tree, archived pages are marked with italic font, while ordinary bookmarks have the regular one.</p>

    <h3>Bookmark Shelves</h3>
    <p>
        It is possible to create an unlimited amount of bookmark shelves to structure your bookmarks.
        The shelf named "everything" allows to browse and search through all existing bookmarks. Scrapyard built-in
        shelves are listed in bold font and cannot be deleted or renamed.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/shelves.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Search</h3>
    <p>The search input field at the Scrapyard sidebar allows filtering bookmarks of the current shelf
        by content and various attributes.
        Use the "Everything" shelf to search through all bookmarks. Although the Sidebar filter is
        reasonably fast, it matches all items that contain every entered word longer than 2 characters
        in any order and distance. Use the full-text search if you need exact results.<p>

    <p>Filtering by date supports simple queries:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="query">2021-02-24</span> - the exact date.</li>
        <li><span class="query"><i>before</i> 2021-02-24</span> - before the specified date (the specified date is not included).</li>
        <li><span class="query"><i>after</i> 2021-02-24</span> - after the specified date (the specified date is not included).</li>
        <li><span class="query"><i>between</i> 2021-02-24 <i>and</i> 2021-03-24</span> - between the specified dates (the specified dates are included).</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/search-sidebar.png">
    </p>

    <p>Additionally, it is possible to search through all bookmarks by title or URL from the Firefox
        URL-bar after entering the special "scr" keyword followed by a space:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/search-urlbar.png">
    </p>

    <p>If URL-bar search text begins with a plus sign (+), Scrapyard will interpret the rest of the
        text as a tag name and will search by tags instead. By assigning unique tags to bookmarks
        (with no leading plus sign) you may quickly open dedicated bookmarks without
        using a mouse. It is possible to activate Firefox URL-bar with the <code>Ctrl+L</code> keyboard shortcut.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/search-urlbar-tags.png">
    </p>

    <p>By creating dedicated <a href="https://gchristensen.github.io/ishell/"
                                target="_blank">iShell</a> commands to open specific bookmarks, you
        may access them even more quickly. A few examples could be found in the <a
            href="https://github.com/GChristensen/scrapyard/blob/master/AUTOMATION.md"
            target="_blank">Scrapyard automation API documentation</a>.</p>

    <p>Full-text search is accessible with the corresponding sidebar button:
        <img src="../../../icons/search.svg" style="margin-bottom: -4px"/>
    and allows to find and highlight the exact occurrences of a phrase in the content of
        archived HTML pages.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/full-text-search.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Firefox Bookmarks</h3>
    <p>
        Scrapyard seamlessly integrates with Firefox bookmarks, so there is no need to switch to the
        built-in bookmark manager. It is possible to attach comments and TODO states to Firefox
        bookmarks displayed in Scrapyard, although they will be lost if the bookmarks are deleted
        from the Firefox UI, or after the "Enable Firefox bookmarks integration" option in settings
        is unchecked. Firefox bookmarks are included in the export as a separate shelf, so import
        will leave the current Firefox bookmark state intact.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/firefox.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Cloud Bookmarking</h3>
    <p>
        Adding or copying/pasting bookmarks into a special shelf named Cloud makes them available
        across different Firefox instances that use a cloud provider with the same credentials.
        Cloud providers are configurable at the addon settings. It is possible to authorize in several
        cloud providers and quickly switch between them (currently only Dropbox and OneDrive are supported).</p>
    <p><a href="https://scrapyard.page.link/android" target="_blank">Scrapyard application for
        Android</a> allows to save links and text into the Cloud shelf from mobile devices,
        and to browse contents of this shelf. See the corresponding section below for more details.
    </p>

    <p>It is not necessary to install native cloud clients or the Scrapyard
    helper application on any OS to use the cloud shelf. Just a Dropbox or a personal Microsoft account is required.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/cloud.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Sharing Bookmarks</h3>
    <p>
        A bookmark or archive could be shared to either <a href="https://getpocket.com/"
                                                           target="_blank">Pocket</a> or a
        cloud service through the "Share" context menu.
        Files that are shared to Dropbox or OneDrive appear at the "Apps/Scrapyard" folder. Only links
        could be shared to the Pocket application.
        The "Cloud" menu item copies any selected items to the Scrapyard Cloud shelf.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/sharing.png">
    </p>

    <h3 id="sync-manual">Synchronization</h3>
    <p>The cloud shelf is aimed primarily for sharing from mobile devices.
        The Sync option allows to maintain an actual copy of Scrapyard content as a
        set of files on disk that could be shared and picked up by different Scrapyard instances
        through a cloud provider of your choice.
        This feature requires the helper application version 0.5 or above. The synchronized
        bookmarks shared through Dropbox or OneDrive also could be browsed in the Scrapyard
        application for Android.</p>

    <p>Note that due to potentially large volume of synchronized content, synchronization is not
        automatic, and is not performed, for example, after you added or deleted a bookmark. To
        receive or send changes to the Sync storage on the disk you need to manually initiate
        synchronization with the corresponding sidebar button. There is an option to synchronize
        automatically in the background for every hour. Please do not close Firefox while the
        Scrapyard synchronization indicator on the browser toolbar is active.
    </p>

    <p>The synchronization algorithm works as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Just after the Sync option is enabled, the content of the Sync storage is
        mutually merged with the content of the Scrapyard database, nothing is deleted.</li>
        <li>During the following synchronizations, any changes (modifications, additions, and deletions)
        found in the Sync storage are propagated to Scrapyard and vice versa.</li>
        <li>The items from restored backups are considered as newly added. If a restored backup
            deletes any existing items, they will also be deleted in the Sync storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Use the path <b>&lt;cloud folder&gt;/Apps/Scrapyard/Sync</b> to make your content available on mobile devices.</p>

    <p>Because this feature can introduce irreversible changes, please consider taking a full backup
        on every Firefox instance where you intend to enable it. If you need to reset Scrapyard or Sync
        storage to perform a clean synchronization, use the corresponding options at the <a
            href="/ui/advanced.html">advanced settings</a>. "Cloud" and "Firefox" bookmark shelves
        are excluded from synchronization and are not affected by the reset.</p>

    <h3>Firefox Multi-Account Containers</h3>

    <p>Any Scrapyard bookmark could be opened in one of the <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers">Firefox Multi-Account containers</a>,
        available through the "Open in Container" context menu of a bookmark, archive, or
        folder. Scrapyard will open the original URL of an archive with this menu,
        and all the items located inside a folder, if a folder is selected.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/containers-menu.png">
    </p>

    <p><br>Additionally, it is possible to assign a container to a bookmark in its property dialog, as
    it is shown in the image below. Such bookmarks will automatically open in the corresponding
    container.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/containers-properties.png">
    </p>

    <h3>TODO</h3>
    <p>It may be convenient to prioritize your bookmarks for processing with TODO states. Each bookmark may have one of the following
        TODO priorities: TODO, WAITING, or POSTPONED. You may find all your prioritized bookmarks
        at the built-in shelf named <b>TODO</b>, sorted in the corresponding order. All bookmarks marked as DONE or CANCELLED
        are displayed on the <b>DONE</b> shelf.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/todo.png">
    </p>

    <p>If the path of the bookmark folder above its title provides not enough context, it is
        possible to fill the "Details" and "Date" fields at the bookmark property dialog. Only ISO
        (YYYY-MM-DD) date format is supported. Expired TODO items will be displayed first regardless
        of the assigned state.</p>

    <h3>Markers</h3>
    <p>Every archived page contains a toolbar that offers several types of text markers to
        highlight sections of interest. The "Auto open" check makes the marker menu to open
        automatically when some text is selected. The "Edit document" button allows to clean the
        document of unnecessary elements by direct editing of its content. It is also possible to
        type in something, press F7 to display the caret. The DOM Eraser tool is able to remove
        any element on the page with a single click. The HTML code of a page may also be
        manually modified through the browser developer tools accessible through the F12 keyboard key.
        Press the "Save" button after you have finished document editing.</p>

    <p>The size of a saved page in bytes and its creation date are available through the page info icon at the right-most toolbar side.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/markers.png">
    </p>

    <p>There is an option to not display the editing toolbar automatically.
       The toolbar always could be toggled by the <code>Ctrl+Alt+T</code> key combination.</p>

    <h3>Bookmark Comments</h3>
    <p>While the "Details" field in the bookmark properties is intended for display at the TODO
        shelf, the bookmark property dialog also allows entering quick comments by clicking on the
        "callout" icon at its top-right corner.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/comments-icon.png">
    </p>

    <p>Subsequent clicks on the icon alternate between the comment input field and bookmark properties.</p>

    <p>The comment icon of bookmarks with filled-in comments takes the form of a "filled callout".</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/filled-comments.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>It is possible to attach more elaborate text notes with hyperlinks and images to every
        bookmark, or even create dedicated note-only bookmarks. Click "New" > "(Attached) Notes" in the context
        menu of a folder, bookmark, or archive to create a note-only bookmark or attach notes. Items
        with non-empty notes are highlighted by the underlined text in the bookmark tree.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/notes.png">
    </p>

        <p>Notes could be entered in rich text format (using a visual editor),
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a>,
        <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Markup.html" target="_blank">Org-mode markup</a>, or plain text.
            The format selector dropdown list is located in the bottom left corner of the "Edit" tab.
            Notes in Org format may have an automatically generated table of contents.
        Insert the example markup into the note editor to explore what options are available.</p>

    <p>The text in the note editor is saved automatically, although you may save it at any time with the <code>Ctrl+S</code>
        keyboard shortcut.</p>

    <h3>Referencing to a bookmark or archive</h3>
    <p>To make a reference to a Scrapyard bookmark or archive from the note markup, create a link with the following URL:
        <b><code>ext+scrapyard://&lt;BOOKMARK UUID&gt;</code></b>, for example:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7</code></b>

    <p>When necessary, it is possible to add a hash with a link description:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7#short-bookmark-description</code></b>

    <p>To refer the notes of a bookmark add <b><code>notes:</code></b> before the UUID:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://notes:A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7</code></b>

    <p>UUID of a bookmark is available from its property dialog:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/references.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Import/Export</h3>

    <p>Scrapyard allows importing bookmarks in Netscape HTML format which you may obtain from Firefox, Chrome, or other
    web-browsers. Its own collections of bookmarks and archived pages could also be exported or imported in ORG and
    JSON formats through the corresponding items of the shelf operations menu:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/impexp.png">
    </p>

    <h3 id="rdf-import-manual">Importing Legacy ScrapBook RDF Archives</h3>

    <p>To import legacy ScrapBook RDF archives you need to install the Scrapyard <a
        href="#helperapp">helper application</a>. There are two import modes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The full import. In this mode, the archived files are completely transferred into the browser
            internal database. This may take a substantial amount of time.
        </li>
        <li>The quick import (default). Import in this mode only recreates the RDF directory
            structure in the Scrapyard database. The archived ScrapBook files are served from the
            disk by the helper application.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The quick import may be useful for arranging the contents of an RDF archive before the full
        import. See the "<a href="#rdf">Import RDF</a>" tab of the settings page for more details
        about the available import options.</p>

    <p>Shelves imported in the quick mode are marked with a tape reel icon. It is possible to add
        new archives to these shelves (simple bookmarks are not included in the underlying RDF
        file), and physically delete RDF entries along with the attached files. Although when a
        quickly imported shelf itself is deleted, the corresponding RDF file and the archived pages are
        left intact. Some features, such as page editing, full-text search, and bookmark
        transferring/copying are not available for the shelves imported in the quick mode.</p>

        <p>It is possible to edit the path of the imported RDF file through the "RDF Directory..." context
        menu item of a shelf.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/quick-imported-rdf.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Backup</h3>
    <p>It is possible to backup contents of any bookmark shelf to a designated directory on the hard
        drive by using the backup manager. This feature requires the helper application version 0.3
        or above. Backups will be automatically compressed if the corresponding option is checked.
        Compression method and level could be chosen in the advanced settings. Methods with better
        compression require more processing time.</p>

    <p>A backup could be restored to the original shelf, imported as a new separate shelf,
        or deleted from the disk through the backup list context menu.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/backup.png">
    </p>


    <h3>Link Checker</h3>
    <p>The automatic link checker allows finding broken links or URL duplicates. Its mode of
        operation may be selected through the "Check for" dropdown list. Since different archived page
        fragments may share the same original URL, link checker results in the "check for duplicates"
        mode may not always mean the duplication of content. Please check the duplicate bookmarks before
        deleting them.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/link-checker.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying Random Bookmarks</h3>

    <p>Random bookmarks from your collection could be displayed at the bottom of the Scrapyard sidebar.
        Check the corresponding option in the settings to enable this feature. The displayed
        bookmark is changed every 5 minutes, it also could be updated by a user request through
        the "Refresh" button. The "Find" button allows locating the bookmark at the Scrapyard sidebar
        by opening its shelf and folder.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">

    <h2>Saving Links and Content from Mobile Applications</h2>

    <p> <a href="https://scrapyard.page.link/android" target="_blank">Scrapyard application for
        Android</a> allows saving links and content into the Scrapyard Cloud shelf from mobile devices.
        It uses the standard Android sharing functionality, which may be tricky to deal
        with, as it is shown in the examples below.</p>

    <p>At first, you need to enable cloud shelf in Scrapyard by checking the corresponding option at
        the "Cloud" setting tab and sign into a cloud service. The bookmarks also may be shared into the
        default Sync shelf, if synchronization is enabled, although it is recommended to use the
        cloud shelf for the sharing from mobile devices.</p>

    <p>Then you need to install the Scrapyard application on your device and sign into the same
        cloud service account from its "Cloud Providers" screen.</p>

    <p>To share a link from the application of choice, find and tap the "Share" button or the "Share" menu item in it.
    The example below highlights the "Share" button in the mobile Firefox application.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/android-share-link.png">
    </p>

    <p>After that, you need to select the destination application to send the URL into. The interface may
        differ from app to app, and you may need to scroll or press additional buttons to find the
        necessary sharing target. The icon of the Scrapyard Android application is highlighted
        in the image below. Tap on it and you are done.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/android-share-app.png">
    </p>

    <p>Sharing of text is usually performed from the corresponding selection toolbar:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">

    </p>

    <p>
        It is only possible to share plain text without links and images from the Android platform.
        Generally, selected text is shared to Scrapyard in the form of notes without a source URL.
        To save source URL, share text from the Pocket app or the recent versions of Chrome browser.
    </p>

    <p>The application also offers basic browsing functionality for the Cloud shelf and synchronized
        bookmarks. Bookmarks, archived pages, and notes could be opened directly. Archived PDF
        documents and other binary files could be downloaded to the device storage memory. There is
        a long-tap context menu which allows to view attached notes and delete bookmarks and
        folders.</p>

    <h2>Text Command Interface</h2>
    <p>
        It is possible to issue commands to Scrapyard through the text command interface offered by
        <a href="https://gchristensen.github.io/ishell/" target="_blank">iShell Extension</a>.
        To control Scrapyard with text commands just install iShell. In most cases, the command interface
        allows to significantly reduce the number of actions needed to create a bookmark or to archive a page.
    </p>

    <h3>The "shelf" Command</h3>

    <p>With the "shelf" command you can quickly switch to a shelf or folder, or even create a new one
    without using a mouse.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/shelf-command.png">
    </p>

    <h3>The "bookmark" and "archive" Commands</h3>

    <p>Use the "bookmark" or "archive" commands with the corresponding arguments to bookmark/archive
        a page into the specified destination. The arguments allow specifying bookmark title, path,
        details, tags, TODO state, and TODO deadline. Folders in the bookmark path will be
        autocompleted by iShell and created in Scrapyard if they do not exist.
        Note that due to the quirks of iShell parser spaces are not welcomed in folder names.
    </p>
    <p>The first folder in the path is
        always interpreted as a shelf name. The tilde (~) character may be used in place of the
        "default" shelf. Contents of the Firefox "Bookmarks Menu" and "Other Bookmarks" bookmark
        folders may be accessed with the "@" and "@@" shortcuts respectively.</p>

        <img src="images/archive-command.png">
    </p>

    <h3>The "copy-at" and "move-at" Commands</h3>

    <p>Use these commands to quickly copy selected bookmarks to a desired shelf/folder
        without using the context menu and navigating through the shelf list and tree. It is
        possible to select bookmarks without opening them by holding Ctrl or Shift keys.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/move-command.png">
    </p>

    <p>The commands accept an additional "by switching" argument that will open the
    destination folder after moving or copying.</p>

    <h3>The "scrapyard" Command</h3>

    <p>The "scrapyard" command allows browsing and search through the collection of bookmarks at
        the specified destination. See iShell command help for more details.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>Creating Custom Capture Commands</h3>

    <p>If you often save bookmarks with similar properties to the same destination, it is possible to create custom
        capture commands with predefined parameters. The "CAPTURE" link at the bottom-right corner of iShell command editor allows
        to insert a template of such command. In addition to the predefined parameters, custom capture commands allow
        specifying comma-separated CSS selectors for elements that will automatically be retained or deleted.
        A custom CSS style could be added to the captured document through the "style" option.</p>

    <h2>Automation</h2>

    <p>The automation API provided by Scrapyard allows to programmatically create,
        modify, and delete bookmarks or page archives from iShell commands and your own extensions.
        See the <a href="https://github.com/GChristensen/scrapyard/blob/master/AUTOMATION.md"
