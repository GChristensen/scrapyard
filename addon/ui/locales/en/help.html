    <h2>What is Scrapyard?</h2>
    <p>Scrapyard is a bookmarking extension where you can store and organize bookmarks, page
        fragments, complete HTML pages and PDF documents, or take notes. All archived
        content is accessible on the Android platform if shared through a
        cloud service. It is possible to export and import bookmarks in <a
            href="https://www.jsonlines.org/">JSON</a> or <a
            href="https://orgmode.org" target="_blank">org-mode</a> formats. Scrapyard also supports
        the import of RDF archives of the legacy ScrapBook addon.
    </p>

    <h3>Where to Find Scrapyard</h3>

    <p>Scrapyard is accessible through the dropdown menu of the <a
        href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-sidebar-access-bookmarks-history-synced"
        target="_blank">Firefox sidebar</a> as shown in the image below.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/find-sidebar.png">
    </p>

    <p>In Chrome, Scrapyard could be opened in a separate window through the <img
        style="display: inline-block" src="images/sidebar-button.png"> button in the popup dialog.</p>

    <p>
        The <code>Alt+Y</code> keyboard shortcut allows to open Scrapyard directly.
        Keyboard shortcuts provided by any extension could be <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox" target="_blank">
        customized</a> in the browser settings.
    </p>

    <h3 id="start">Getting Started</h3>

    <p class="transition-help-warning"><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Scrapyard version 2 stores the archived content in the filesystem.
    Please see the <a href="#transition">transition manual</a> from the Scrapyard version 1.</p>

    <h4>1. Installing the Helper Application</h4>
    <p>
        Scrapyard requires the native helper application to access the filesystem.
        Please install the helper application using one of the download links provided in
        the <a href="options.html#helperapp">Helper App</a> options tab.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Specifying the Data Directory Path</h4>
    <p>
        Specify the data directory path at the <a href="options.html#settings">Settings</a> tab.
        Use the path <b>&lt;your cloud folder&gt;/Apps/Scrapyard/Sync</b> to make Scrapyard content available on mobile devices.
        Only content shared through Dropbox or OneDrive could be browsed with the Scrapyard application for Android.
    </p>

    <p>A limited subset of functionality is available without the helper application if the "Content location" option
    in the main settings page is set to "Browser internal storage"<span class="transition-help-warning">
            (not available if content transfer is required)</span>.
    Please use this mode only in the cases when the amount of archived content is relatively small.</p>

    <h2>Main Features</h2>

    <h3 id="page-capture-manual">Capturing Pages</h3>
    <p>
        To capture a web page or its fragment, select the part of the page you want to archive, open the Scrapyard popup dialog
        by clicking its icon on the browser toolbar, choose the destination shelf and folder, then press the "Bookmark"
        or "Archive" button. The "Bookmark" button stores only web-page URLs as bookmarks. The "Archive" button captures
        the current selection, the whole page, if there is no active selection, or the whole document, if the opened
        link is not a web-page (for example, a PDF file). </p>

    <p>In the bookmark tree, archived pages are marked with italic font, while ordinary bookmarks have the regular one.
       It is possible to additionally emphasize archives by enabling the corresponding add-on settings.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/capture-popup.png">
    </p>

    <p>
        The following keyboard shortcuts allow to quickly capture the
        active tab into the default bookmark shelf:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>Alt+Q</code> - bookmark the current tab to the default shelf.</li>
        <li><code>Alt+W</code> - archive the current tab or selection to the default shelf.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If these shortcuts are already overridden by some other add-on, they could be <a
        href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox"
        target="_blank"> customized</a> in Firefox settings. There is an option to open the sidebar
        automatically when bookmarking from keyboard.</p>

    <h3 id="site-capture-manual">Capturing Sites</h3>
    <p>To create an offline copy of a website, enable the site capture mode by clicking on the
       white circle icon inside the "Archive" button.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/site-capture-mode.png">
    </p>

    <p>A click on the "Archive Site" button will display the site capture options dialog:
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/site-capture-options.png">
    </p>

    <p>
        <a id="for-read-more-site-capture-options" href="#" onclick="expandReadMore(event)">Read more about site capture options</a>
    </p>

    <div id="read-more-site-capture-options" style="display: none;">
    <p>"Include links" and "Exclude links" text areas of the capture options dialog allow to specify
        rules to filter visited links. There are two modes in which rules may be specified: plain
        strings (case-insensitive), or, if a rule starts and ends with a slash character, it defines
        a <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions"
            target="_blank">regular expression</a>. Optional regular expression flags may be placed
        after the trailing slash. There is no need to escape the slash character itself inside the
        regular expression rules.</p>

    <p>There are also two scopes in which rules are applied. By default, the rules are matched
    against link URLs. In URL-scoped rules, any text after the first space character is ignored.
        If a rule is prefixed with the <b>$text:</b> prefix, it will be matched
    against the link text. Such rules may contain spaces.</p>
    <p>
        Examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The rule <b>/^https?://example\.com/path//i</b> case-insensitively allows only links
            <i>beginning</i> with <i>http://example.com/path/</i> or <i>https://example.com/path/</i>.</li>
        <li>The rule <b>https://example.com/path/page.html [some text]</b> will only match against the string
            <i>https://example.com/path/page.html</i>, all other strings will be rejected.</li>
        <li>The rule <b>$text:/^Chapter \d+$/</b> will case-sensitively match against links with text
            <i>Chapter 1</i>, <i>Chapter 2</i>, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Several automatically generated presets are available. Generally, you
        may want to select the preset "Same site" in the "Include links" window
        to filter out all external URLs.
    </p>

    <p>
        By default, Scrapyard will visit and save <i>all links</i> within the given crawling depth.
        The default crawling depth of 1 means that only links found on the active tab will be visited.
        If the captured site throttles page access rate, the delay option may become useful.
        Link hashes (any text after the # symbol) are ignored if the "Ignore link hashes" check
        is selected. You may want to uncheck it if you are capturing a single page
        application in which pages are generated dynamically by the browser, based on link hash values.
    </p>
    </div>

    <p>The captured pages are placed in a dedicated folder with the spider web icon. A click on the
        folder name opens the first page stored inside it. All linked pages in this folder refer
        to each other through the special <a href="#help:referencing-manual">ext+scrapyard://</a> URLs.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/captured-site.png">
    </p>

    <p>To abort the ongoing capture process, use the corresponding item from the sidebar
        shelf menu: </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/abort-menu.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Archive Toolbar</h3>
    <p>Every archived page contains a toolbar that offers several types of text markers to
        highlight sections of interest. The "Auto open" check makes the marker menu to open
        automatically when some text is selected. The "Edit document" button allows to clean the
        document of unnecessary elements by direct editing of its content. It is also possible to
        type in something, press F7 to display the caret. The DOM Eraser tool is able to remove
        any element on the page with a single click. The HTML code of a page may also be
        manually modified through the browser developer tools accessible through the F12 keyboard key.
        Press the "Save" button after you have finished document editing.</p>

    <p>The size of a saved page in bytes and its creation date are available through the page info icon at the right-most toolbar side.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/markers.png">
    </p>

    <p>There is an option to not display the editing toolbar automatically.
        The toolbar always could be toggled by the <code>Ctrl+Alt+T</code> key combination.</p>

    <h3>Bookmark Shelves</h3>
    <p>
        It is possible to create an unlimited amount of bookmark shelves to structure your bookmarks.
        The shelf named "everything" allows to browse and search through all existing bookmarks. Scrapyard built-in
        shelves are listed in bold font and cannot be deleted or renamed.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/shelves.png">
    </p>

    <p>If you mistakenly deleted a bookmark or even an entire shelf, it is possible to revert the
    deletion using the "Undo" item of the shelf menu <img height="15px" width="15px" src="../../../icons/menu.svg">.
        The undo operation is available until the browser is restarted or some other operation is performed.</p>

    <h3>TODO</h3>
    <p>It may be convenient to prioritize your bookmarks for processing with TODO states. Each bookmark may have one of the following
        TODO priorities: TODO, WAITING, or POSTPONED. You may find all your prioritized bookmarks
        at the built-in shelf named <b>TODO</b>. All bookmarks marked as DONE or CANCELLED
        are displayed on the <b>DONE</b> shelf.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/todo.png">
    </p>

    <p>If the path of the bookmark folder above its title provides not enough context, it is
        possible to fill the "Details" and "Date" fields at the bookmark property dialog. Only ISO
        (YYYY-MM-DD) date format is supported. Expired TODO items will be displayed first regardless
        of the assigned state.</p>

    <h3>Browser Bookmarks</h3>
    <p>
        Scrapyard seamlessly integrates with the browser bookmarks, so there is no need to switch to the
        built-in bookmark manager. Browser bookmarks are not included in the export or backups.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/firefox.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Cloud Bookmarking</h3>
    <p>
        Adding or copying/pasting bookmarks into a special shelf named Cloud makes them available
        across different browser instances that use a cloud provider with the same credentials.
        Cloud providers are configurable in the addon settings. It is possible to authorize in several
        cloud providers and quickly switch between them (currently only Dropbox and OneDrive are supported).</p>
    <p><a href="https://scrapyard.page.link/android" target="_blank">Scrapyard application for
        Android</a> allows to save links and text into the Cloud shelf from mobile devices,
        and to browse contents of this shelf. See the corresponding section below for more details.
    </p>

    <p>It is not necessary to install native cloud clients on any OS to use the cloud shelf.
        Just a Dropbox or a personal Microsoft account is required.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/cloud.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Sharing Bookmarks</h3>
    <p>
        A bookmark or archive could be shared to either <a href="https://getpocket.com/"
                                                           target="_blank">Pocket</a> or a
        cloud service through the "Share" context menu.
        Files that are shared to Dropbox or OneDrive appear at the "Apps/Scrapyard" folder. Only links
        could be shared to the Pocket application.
        The "Cloud" menu item copies any selected items to the Scrapyard Cloud shelf.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/sharing.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Firefox Multi-Account Containers</h3>

    <p>Any Scrapyard bookmark could be opened in one of the <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers">Firefox Multi-Account containers</a>,
        available through the "Open in Container" context menu of a bookmark, archive, or
        folder. Scrapyard will open the original URL of an archive with this menu,
        and all the items located inside a folder, if a folder is selected.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/containers-menu.png">
    </p>

    <p><br>Additionally, it is possible to assign a container to a bookmark in its property dialog, as
        it is shown in the image below. Such bookmarks will automatically open in the corresponding
        container.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/containers-properties.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Bookmark Comments</h3>
    <p>While the "Details" field in the bookmark properties is intended for display at the TODO
        shelf, the bookmark property dialog also allows entering quick comments by clicking on the
        "callout" icon at its top-right corner.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/comments-icon.png">
    </p>

    <p>Subsequent clicks on the icon alternate between the comment input field and bookmark properties.</p>

    <p>The comment icon of bookmarks with filled-in comments takes the form of a "filled callout".</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/filled-comments.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>It is possible to attach more elaborate text notes with hyperlinks and images to every
        bookmark, or even create dedicated note-only bookmarks. Click "New" > "(Attached) Notes" in the context
        menu of a folder, bookmark, or archive to create a note-only bookmark or attach notes. Items
        with non-empty notes are highlighted by the underlined text in the bookmark tree.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/notes.png">
    </p>

    <p>Notes could be entered in rich text format (using a visual editor),
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a>,
        <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Markup.html" target="_blank">Org-mode markup</a>, or plain text.
        The format selector dropdown list is located in the bottom left corner of the "Edit" tab.
        Notes in Org format may have an automatically generated table of contents.
        Insert the example markup into the note editor to explore what options are available.</p>

    <p>The text in the note editor is saved automatically, although you may save it at any time with the <code>Ctrl+S</code>
        keyboard shortcut.</p>

    <h3 id="referencing-manual">Referencing to a bookmark or archive (Firefox only)</h3>
    <p>To make a reference to a Scrapyard bookmark or archive from the note markup, create a link with the following URL:
        <b><code>ext+scrapyard://&lt;BOOKMARK UUID&gt;</code></b>, for example:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7</code></b>

    <p>When necessary, it is possible to add a hash with a link description:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7#short-bookmark-description</code></b>

    <p>To refer the notes of a bookmark add <b><code>notes:</code></b> before the UUID:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><code>ext+scrapyard://notes:A4D409A0D1034D9BA0863E9DA8CE8FE7</code></b>

    <p>UUID of a bookmark is available from its property dialog:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/references.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Search</h3>

    <h4>Sidebar Filtering</h4>

    <p>The input field at the Scrapyard sidebar allows filtering bookmarks of the current shelf
        by content and various other attributes:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/search-sidebar.png">
    </p>

    <p>Use the "Everything" search mode (default) to filter bookmarks by all available attributes.
        Use the "Everything" shelf to search through all bookmarks. Although the Sidebar filter is
        reasonably fast, it matches all items that contain every entered word longer than two
        characters in any order and distance. Use the full-text search if you need exact results.
    <p>

    <p>Filtering by date supports simple queries:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="query">2020-02-20</span> - the exact date.</li>
        <li><span class="query"><i>before</i> 2020-02-20</span> - before the specified date (the specified date is not included).</li>
        <li><span class="query"><i>after</i> 2020-02-20</span> - after the specified date (the specified date is not included).</li>
        <li><span class="query"><i>between</i> 2020-02-20 <i>and</i> 2020-03-20</span> - between the specified dates (the specified dates are included).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Search from URL-bar</h4>

    <p>It is possible to search through all bookmarks by title or URL from the browser
        URL-bar after entering the special "scr" keyword followed by a space:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/search-urlbar.png">
    </p>

    <p>If URL-bar search query begins with a plus sign (+), Scrapyard will interpret the rest of the
        text as a tag name and will search by tags instead. It is possible to activate browser URL-bar
        with the <code>Ctrl+L</code> keyboard shortcut.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/search-urlbar-tags.png">
    </p>

    <h4>Full-Text Search</h4>

    <p>Full-text search is accessible with the corresponding sidebar button:
        <img src="../../../icons/search.svg" style="margin-bottom: -4px"/>.
        It allows to find and highlight the exact occurrences of a phrase in the content of
        archived HTML pages.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/full-text-search.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Import/Export</h3>

    <p>Scrapyard allows importing bookmarks in Netscape HTML format which you may obtain from Firefox, Chrome, or other
    web-browsers. Its own collections of bookmarks and archived pages could also be exported or imported in JSON and
    ORG formats through the corresponding items of the shelf operations menu:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/impexp.png">
    </p>

    <h3 id="rdf-import-manual">Importing Legacy ScrapBook RDF Archives</h3>

    <p>RDF archives could be imported from the corresponding <a href="options.html#rdf">options tab</a>.
        There are two import modes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Import RDF to Scrapyard</b>. In this mode, the archived files are transferred into the
            scrapyard storage directory. After the import, the original RDF folder is not necessary
            to access the imported archives from Scrapyard.
        </li>
        <li><b>Open RDF for editing</b>. Import in this mode only recreates the RDF directory
            structure in the Scrapyard internal browser storage.
            The archived ScrapBook files are served from their original RDF folder.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The recent import mode may be useful for arranging the contents of an RDF archive before the full
        import (RDF editing is available on Firefox only). Shelves imported in the editing mode are
        marked with a tape reel icon. It is possible to add
        new archives to these shelves and physically delete RDF entries along with the attached
        files (this could not be undone). Some features, such as bookmark transferring or copying are
        not available for the shelves imported in the editing mode.</p>

    <p>It is possible to edit the path of the imported RDF file through the "RDF Directory..." context
        menu item of a shelf.</p>

    <!--h3>Backup</h3>
    <p>It is possible to backup contents of any bookmark shelf to a designated directory on the hard
        drive by using the backup manager. This feature requires the helper application version 0.3
        or above. Backups will be automatically compressed if the corresponding option is checked.
        Compression method and level could be chosen in the advanced settings. Methods with better
        compression require more processing time.</p>

    <p>A backup could be restored to the original shelf, imported as a new separate shelf,
        or deleted from the disk through the backup list context menu.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">

    </p-->

    <h3>Link Checker</h3>
    <p>The automatic link checker allows finding broken links or URL duplicates. Its mode of
        operation may be selected through the "Check for" dropdown list. Since different archived page
        fragments may share the same original URL, link checker results in the "check for duplicates"
        mode may not always mean the duplication of content. Please check the duplicate bookmarks before
        deleting them.</p>

    <h3>Displaying Random Bookmarks</h3>

    <p>Random bookmarks from your collection could be displayed at the bottom of the Scrapyard sidebar.
        Check the corresponding option in the settings to enable this feature. The displayed
        bookmark is changed every 5 minutes, it also could be updated by a user request through
        the "Refresh" button. The "Find" button allows locating the bookmark at the Scrapyard sidebar
        by opening its shelf and folder.</p>

    <h2>Saving Links and Content from Mobile Applications</h2>

    <p> <a href="https://scrapyard.page.link/android" target="_blank">Scrapyard application for
        Android</a> allows saving links and content into the Scrapyard Cloud shelf from mobile devices.
        It uses the standard Android sharing functionality, which may be tricky to deal
        with, as it is shown in the examples below.</p>

    <p>At first, you need to enable cloud shelf in Scrapyard by checking the corresponding option at
        the "<a href="options.html#cloud">Cloud</a>" setting tab and sign into a cloud service. The bookmarks also may be shared into the
        default Sync shelf, if synchronization is enabled, although it is recommended to use the
        cloud shelf for the sharing from mobile devices.</p>

    <p>Then you need to install the Scrapyard application on your device and sign into the same
        cloud service account from its "Cloud Providers" screen.</p>

    <p>To share a link from the application of choice, find and tap the "Share" button or the "Share" menu item in it.
    The example below highlights the "Share" button in the mobile Firefox application.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/android-share-link.png">
    </p>

    <p>After that, you need to select the destination application to send the URL into. The interface may
        differ from app to app, and you may need to scroll or press additional buttons to find the
        necessary sharing target. The icon of the Scrapyard Android application is highlighted
        in the image below. Tap on it and you are done.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/android-share-app.png">
    </p>

    <p>Sharing of text is usually performed from the corresponding selection toolbar:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/android-share-text.png">
    </p>

    <p>
        It is only possible to share plain text without links and images from the Android platform.
        Generally, selected text is shared to Scrapyard in the form of notes without a source URL.
        To save source URL, share text from the Pocket app or the recent versions of Chrome browser.
    </p>

    <p>The application also offers basic browsing functionality for the Cloud shelf and synchronized
        bookmarks. Bookmarks, archived pages, and notes could be opened directly. Archived PDF
        documents and other binary files could be downloaded to the device storage memory. There is
        a long-tap context menu which allows to view attached notes and delete bookmarks and
        folders.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/android-cloud-shelf.png">
    </p>


    <h2>Text Command Interface</h2>
    <p>
        It is possible to issue commands to Scrapyard through the text command interface offered by
        <a href="https://gchristensen.github.io/ishell/" target="_blank">iShell Extension</a>.
        To control Scrapyard with text commands just install iShell. In most cases, the command interface
        allows to significantly reduce the number of actions needed to create a bookmark or to archive a page.
    </p>

    <h3>The "shelf" Command</h3>

    <p>With the "shelf" command you can quickly switch to a shelf or folder, or even create a new one
    without using a mouse.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/shelf-command.png">
    </p>

    <h3>The "bookmark" and "archive" Commands</h3>

    <p>Use the "bookmark" or "archive" commands with the corresponding arguments to bookmark/archive
        a page into the specified destination. The arguments allow specifying bookmark title, path,
        details, tags, TODO state, and TODO deadline. Folders in the bookmark path will be
        autocompleted by iShell and created in Scrapyard if they do not exist.
        Note that due to the quirks of iShell parser spaces are not welcomed in folder names.
        It is possible to use dashes instead.
    </p>
    <p>The first folder in the path is
        always interpreted as a shelf name. The tilde (~) character may be used in place of the
        "default" shelf. Contents of the Firefox "Bookmarks Menu" and "Other Bookmarks" bookmark
        folders may be accessed with the "@" and "@@" shortcuts respectively.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/archive-command.png">
    </p>

    <h3>The "copy-at" and "move-at" Commands</h3>

    <p>Use these commands to quickly copy selected bookmarks to a desired shelf/folder
        without using the context menu and navigating through the shelf list and tree. It is
        possible to select bookmarks without opening them by holding Ctrl or Shift keys.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/move-command.png">
    </p>

    <p>The commands accept an additional "by switching" argument that will open the
    destination folder after moving or copying.</p>

    <h3>The "scrapyard" Command</h3>

    <p>The "scrapyard" command allows browsing and search through the collection of bookmarks at
        the specified destination. See iShell command help for more details.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="images/scrapyard-command.png">
    </p>

    <h3>Creating Custom Capture Commands</h3>

    <p>If you often save bookmarks with similar properties to the same destination, it is possible to create custom
        capture commands with predefined parameters. The "CAPTURE" link at the bottom-right corner of iShell command editor allows
        to insert a template of such command. In addition to the predefined parameters, custom capture commands allow
        specifying comma-separated CSS selectors for elements that will automatically be retained or deleted.
        A custom CSS style could be added to the captured document through the "style" option.</p>
