<div style="background:#f90;text-align:center;">Hint since v1.3.2: Please re-download and install backend to make Scrapyard safer</div>
<h2>What's Scrapyard?</h2>
Scrapyard is a Firefox Quantum extension trying to inherit some properties of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScrapBook" target="_blank">ScrapBook</a>,
at least, it can read/write data left over from ScrapBook (of course, we can create new). For ScrapBook do not support Firefox Quantum, Scrapyard is expected to be
an extension acts like ScrapBook under Firefox Quantum.
<p>With Scrapyard, you can save web page scraps to local storage, and manage scraps in browser sidebar。</p>
<h2>What's Rdf?</h2>
Rdf is Scrapyard/ScrapBook's data file in which properties of scraps stored in. And downloaded scraps will be saved in "data" folder beside the rdf file.
<h2>Install/Setup</h2>
After Scrapyard installed, please just finish <a href="#initiate">Initiate</a> steps before using Scrapyard.
<h2>How to use?</h2>
<img src="image/hints/01.png" class="" alt="" />
<p class=""> Click on Scrapyard Icon, Scrapyard will be opened in sidebar(Mark1), create folders in sidebar if needed.(Mark2) </p>

<h4>Be Ware</h4>
Whatever you are capturing, please keep Scrapyard opened in sidebar, entity of scraps captured will be saved to position in sidebar currently selected(if no folder/entity selected, it will be saved to the end of top level). Also, you can move entities around by dragging them.
<h2>Trouble Shooting</h2>
<h4>Port</h4>
If Scrapyard stop working, and if you see error message in <a href="#log">Log</a> window like:
<div class="embeded-log-text"> error: listen tcp :9900: bind: address already in use</div>
Please try to kill the process binds on that port manually, e.g. under Linux you can do:
<div class="embeded-log-text">fuser -k 9900/tcp</div>
Or try another backend port in <a href="#settings">Settings</a>
<h4>File system permission</h4>
Please do not register rdfs under a directory without read/write permission for current user,
e.g. common users have no write permission of Windows root directory like c:\, but sub directory of that like c:\foobar works in general.
<h4>Reported as Trojan malware</h4>
Backend of Scrapyard is likely treated as Trojan by  scanners, please add Scrapyard to white list of scanners to prevent miss-block/mis-kill, please contact me if you have a better solution。
<h4>Download installation scripts fails</h4>
If you can not download the installation scripts for some reason, e.g. mis-blocked by security tools.
Please try to re-download the backend:
<br/>Close Firefox->Delete files under “<i>FIREFOX-DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY</i>/scrapyard/”->Start Firefox->Download again
<br/><br/>If this not helps, please create the scripts manually in “<i>FIREFOX-DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY</i>/scrapyard/”:
<br /> <br />
scrapyard_backend.json: (<b>Important:</b> replace "<b><i>FIREFOX-DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY</i></b>" to your real <b>FireFox DOWNLOAD DIRECTORY</b>)
