    <h2>What is Scrapyard?</h2>
    <p>Scrapyard is a Firefox extension where you can store and organize bookmarks, page fragments or complete documents
        in unlimited quantities. By utilizing browser local storage Scrapyard does not require
        external tools to operate and allows to import/export data in
        <a href="https://orgmode.org" target="_blank">org-mode</a> or <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> formats.</p>

    <h2>General features</h2>

    <h3>Capturing Pages</h3>
    <p>
        To capture a web-page or its fragment, select the page part you want to archive, open Scrapyard popup window
        by clicking the icon on browser toolbar, choose the necessary destination folder and press the "Bookmark"
        or "Archive" button. The "Bookmark" button stores only web-page URLs, while the "Archive" button stores the
        current selection, the whole page (if there is no active selection) or the whole document, if the opened link
        is not a web-page. <br/><br/>

        <div style="text-align: center">

        </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Bookmark Shelves</h3>
    <p>
        It is possible to create unlimited amount of bookmark shelves to structure your captures.
        The shelf named "everything" allows to browse and search through all existing shelves. Scrapyard built-in
        shelves are listed in bold font and cannot be deleted or renamed (including the "default" one).</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">
            <img src="_locales/en/images/shelves.png">
        </p>

    <p>In the bookmark tree archived pages are marked with the italic font, while ordinary bookmarks have the regular one.</p>

    <h3>Firefox Bookmarks</h3>
    <p>
        Scrapyard seamlessly integrates with Frirefox bookmarks, so you do not need to switch to the built-in bookmark
        manager. You may attach notes and TODO states to Firefox bookmarks displayed in Scrapyard, although
        they will be lost if the bookmarks are deleted, or after you have unchecked "Show Firefox bookmarks shelf"
        option in settings.

    </p>

    <h3>TODO</h3>
    <p>It may be convenient to prioritize your bookmarks for processing. Each bookmark may be assigned one of the following
        TODO priorities: TODO, WAITING or POSTPONED. You may find all your prioritized bookmarks
        at the built-in shelf named <b>TODO</b>, sorted in the corresponding order. All bookmarks marked as DONE or CANCELLED
        are displayed at the <b>DONE</b> shelf.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="_locales/en/images/todo.png">
    </p>

    <p>If the path of a bookmark provides not enough context, it is possible to fill the "Details" and "Date"
        fields in bookmark properties. Only ISO (YYYY-MM-DD) date format is supported.
        Expired TODO items will be displayed first regardless of the assigned state.</p>

    <h3>Markers</h3>
    <p>If you often review your captures, it may be useful to highlight important key points.
        At every archived page there is a editing toolbar which provides several types of text markers and also allows
        to clean pages of unnecessary elements. Page HTML may also be edited with browser development tools, accessible
        through F12 keyboard key.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="_locales/en/images/markers.png">
    </p>

    <p>The "Auto open" check makes the marker menu to open automatically when some text is selected.</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>It is possible to attach notes to every bookmark or even create dedicated note-only bookmarks. Items with
        non-empty notes are marked by underlined text in the bookmark tree.
        The notes may contain a brief document summary or any other relevant information and should be entered in
    <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Markup.html" target="_blank">org-mode markup</a>. It is also possible to attach a short
        style-sheet to modify their appearance. Insert an example markup at the note editor to explore what options are
    available.</p>

    <h2>Advanced features</h2>

    <h3>Natural Language Interface (optional)</h3>
    <p>
        It is possible to issue commands to Scrapyard through the natural language interface offered by
        <a href="https://gchristensen.github.io/ubiquitywe/"  target="_blank">UbiquityWE</a> extension.
        To control Scrapyard by text commands just install UbiquityWE. In the most cases the command interface
        allows to significantly reduce number of actions needed to create a bookmark or archive.
    </p>

    <h3>The "bookmark" and "archive" Commands</h3>
        <p>Use the "bookmark" or "archive" commands with the corresponding parameters to archive a page into the required destination.
        The folders in the bookmark path will be created automatically if they do not exist. The first folder in the path
        is always the name of a bookmark shelf. The name of the 'default' shelf may be substituted by '~' character.
        Contents of Firefox "Bookmarks Menu" and "Other Bookmarks" may be accessed through "@" and "@@" shortcuts respectively.</p>

    <h3>The "scrapyard" Command</h3>

    <p>The "scrapyard" command allows to browse and filter captured bookmarks. See Ubiquity help for more details.

    </p>

    <h3>Creating Custom Capture Commands</h3>

    <p>If you often save bookmarks with similar properties to the same destination, it is possible to create custom
        capture commands with predefined parameters. "CAPTURE" link at the bottom-right of UbiquityWE command editor allows
        to insert a template of such command. In addition to the predefined parameters, custom capture commands allow to
        specify (comma-separated) CSS selectors for elements that will be captured and deleted automatically.
        For example, if the ".article-body,.comments" selectors are specified, only the content of these HTML elements
        will be captured. A custom CSS-style could be inserted into the captured document through the "style" option.</p>
