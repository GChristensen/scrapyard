# Scrapyard

A Scrapbook alternative for Firefox Quantum.

This is a development page. Please visit the main site at: https://gchristensen.github.io/scrapyard/

### Background

Since the departure of Scrapbook, I have converted all my Scrapbook stuff into
an org-mode-based wiki, but it was very painful to add bookmarks there.
I needed a bookmark manager with some org-mode goodness that I would be able to
control from [iShell](https://gchristensen.github.io/ishell/). To
obtain the desired features, I decided to
rewrite [vctfence's](https://github.com/vctfence) ScrapBee from scratch cross-breeding
it with [SavePageWE](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/save-page-we/).

### JSON Scrapbook File Format

The JSON Scrapbook file format used by Scrapyard to store archived content is documented
[here](https://github.com/GChristensen/scrapyard/wiki/JSON-Scrapbook-File-Format).
