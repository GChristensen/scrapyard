# Scrapyard

A Scrapbook alternative for Firefox Quantum.

This is a development page. Please visit the main site at: https://gchristensen.github.io/scrapyard/

### Background

Since the departure of Scrapbook, I have converted all my Scrapbook stuff into
an org-mode-based wiki, but it was very painful to add bookmarks there. Because
I needed a bookmark manager with some org-mode goodness that I would be able to
control from [iShell](https://gchristensen.github.io/ishell/), I decided to
rewrite [vctfence's](https://github.com/vctfence) ScrapBee from scratch to
obtain the desired features.

### Manifest v3 Status

The addon is successfully ported to manifest v3 as it is
[implemented](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/manifest-v3-migration-guide/)
in Firefox Nightly v102. To run with MV3 rename manifest.json.mv3 to manifest.json.
