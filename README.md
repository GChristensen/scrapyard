# Scrapyard

A Scrapbook alternative for Firefox Quantum.

This is a development page. Please visit the main site at: https://gchristensen.github.io/scrapyard/

### Background

Since the departure of Scrapbook I have converted all my Scrapbook stuff into an org-mode
based wiki, but it was very painful to add bookmarks there. Because I needed a bookmark
manager with some org-mode goodness which I would be able to control from [iShell](https://gchristensen.github.io/ishell/),
I decided to rewrite [vctfence's](https://github.com/vctfence) ScrapBee from scratch
to obtain the desired features.

It is 2020s now, and it may be a right time to abandon XML-based RDF and move towards databases, JSON
and cloud services. For an advanced user Scrapyard may become a cloud bookmarking solution of choice. Please see
the [online help](https://gchristensen.github.io/scrapyard/addon/ui/locales/en/help.html) for more details.
