# Scrapyard

Hacker's bookmark manager (coming soon)

This is a development page. Please visit the main site at: https://gchristensen.github.io/scrapyard/

### Background

Since the departure of Scrapbook I have converted all my Scrapbook stuff to an org-mode
based wiki, but it is very painful to add bookmarks there. Since I needed a bookmark 
manager with some org-mode goodness which I would be able to control from UbiquityWE, 
I decided to rewrite ScrapBee from scratch to obtain the desired features.

### Import from RDF

Although it is possible in principle (for example, through an external python/flask
based utility which will  serve saved Scrapbook files), this is not in author's 
set of priorities, but you may contribute. 

### Objectives
