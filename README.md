# Scrapyard

A Scrapbook alternative for Firefox Quantum.

This is a development page. Please visit the main site at: https://gchristensen.github.io/scrapyard/

ScrapBook was a brilliant extension. I haven't found a usable alternative, and I hope that I was able
to make an extension that is as usable as the legacy ScrapBook itself.

### Credits

* vclfence's [ScrapBee](https://github.com/vctfence/scrapbee) was used as a starting point,
although currently almost no code from ScrapBee is left in Scrapyard.
* The modified engine of [SavePageWe](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/save-page-we/)
is used to capture pages.


### JSON Scrapbook File Format

The JSON Scrapbook archive format used by Scrapyard is documented
[here](https://github.com/GChristensen/scrapyard/wiki/JSON-Scrapbook-File-Format).
